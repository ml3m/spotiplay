## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd spotify-song-guessing-game
npm install
```

### 2. Spotify Developer Setup

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Add these redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify` (development)
   - `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/spotify` (production)
4. Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 3. Supabase Setup

1. Create a new project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to SQL Editor and run this schema:

```sql
-- Enable UUID extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

-- Rooms table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rooms (
  id uuid DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  code varchar(6) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  host_spotify_id varchar NOT NULL,
  host_name varchar NOT NULL,
  playlist_id varchar,
  playlist_name varchar,
  status varchar DEFAULT 'waiting' CHECK (status IN ('waiting', 'playing', 'finished')),
  current_song integer DEFAULT 0,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  expires_at timestamptz DEFAULT (now() + interval '24 hours')
);

-- Players table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS players (
  id uuid DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  room_code varchar(6) REFERENCES rooms(code) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name varchar NOT NULL,
  score integer DEFAULT 0,
  joined_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(room_code, name)
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rooms_code ON rooms(code);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rooms_expires_at ON rooms(expires_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_players_room_code ON players(room_code);

-- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
ALTER TABLE rooms ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE players ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow read access to all authenticated users
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Allow read access to rooms" ON rooms FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Allow read access to players" ON players FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Allow insert/update/delete only for service role
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Allow service role full access to rooms" ON rooms FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Allow service role full access to players" ON players FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

3. Get your project URL and API keys from Settings > API
